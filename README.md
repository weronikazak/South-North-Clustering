The final Capstone Project for IBM Data Science course.

My main purpose in this project is to compare the capitals of two different countries in Europe, that is Italy and Norway. Since the climate and temperature are different, it may be worth exploring what kind of venues or types of business can you find in Oslo and Rome and how much these two cities differ.

The aim of this project is to answer questions:
- What kind of business is the most profitable in these places?
- Do people living in western countries have different ways of spending time than in the colder North?

This project may be interesting for those, who have money and an idea of some kind of business in Europe, but are not sure, where should they start it.
